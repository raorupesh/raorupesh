## About Me

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science with a strong interest in **backend systems, full-stack development, and cloud-native architectures**. I enjoy translating real-world problems into clean, maintainable software and thinking deeply about **design tradeoffs, scalability, and reliability**.

My approach to engineering emphasizes:
- Clear system design and data modeling
- Writing readable, testable, and extensible code
- Understanding failure modes and edge cases
- Continuous learning through hands-on projects
